The purpose of the **Global Schema** is to give you a common schema that you CAN pull from when setting up Graphs. This is helpful if you have common elements between your different Graphs and want those common elements to have the same schema. For example, my **Global Schema** might contain the entirety of information about my supply chain. Everything from suppliers, warehouses, transportation lines, user orders, product information, user shipping information. However, one of our Graphs might want to only contain information about the suppliers, warehouses, and transportation as that side of the business doesn't need access to customer information. I could use just those elements and their edges from the Global Schema to populate this Graph without having to include all fo the information about the ordering user."

I can include the suppliers, warehouses, and transportation from the Global Schema, but I can also add in something like weather forecasts and supply forecasts that could be used to predict disruptions to my manufacturing chain. This data can exist in the Graph Schema for the Manufacturing Graph, but not in the Global Schema"
