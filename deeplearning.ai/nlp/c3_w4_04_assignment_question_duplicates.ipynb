Natural Language Processing, and AI in general we use batches when training our data sets. If you were to use stochastic gradient descent with one example at a time, it will take you forever to build a model. In this example, we show you how you can build a data generator that takes in $Q1$ and $Q2$ and returns a batch of size `batch_size`  in the following format $([q1_1, q1_2, q1_3, ...]$, $[q2_1, q2_2,q2_3, ...])$. The tuple consists of two arrays and each array has `batch_size` questions. Again, $q1_i$ and $q2_i$ are duplicates, but they are not duplicates with any other elements in the batch. \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","The command ```next(data_generator)```returns the next batch.

To achieve this without modifying the actual question lists, a list containing the indexes of the questions is created. This list can be shuffled and used to get random batches everytime the index is reset.\n","- Append elements of $Q1$ and $Q2$ to `input1` and `input2` respectively.\n","- if `len(input1) == batch_size`, determine `max_len` as the longest question in `input1` and `input2`. Ceil `max_len` to a power of $2$ (for computation purposes) using the following command:  `max_len = 2**int(np.ceil(np.log2(max_len)))`.\n","- Pad every question by `vocab['<PAD>']` until you get the length `max_len`.\n","- Use yield to return `input1, input2`. \n","- Don't forget to reset `input1, input2`  to empty arrays at the end (data generator resumes from where it last left)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rYxhSBNGA1Fy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1612095496086,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":610,"user":{"displayName":"Martin Fabbri","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GimIntWE1SvxJeoWOj0PwvUuB_-simILm2JI8het08=s64","userId":"04899005791450850059"}}},"source":["# UNQ_C1 (UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)\n","# GRADED FUNCTION: data_generator\n","def data_generator(Q1, Q2, batch_size, pad=1, shuffle=True):\n","    \"\"\"Generator function that yields batches of data\n","\n","    Args:\n","        Q1 (list): List of transformed (to tensor) questions.\n","        Q2 (list): List of transformed (to tensor) questions.\n","        batch_size (int): Number of elements per batch.\n","        pad (int, optional): Pad character from the vocab.

V1[3] and V2[3] match exactly again while V1[4] and V2[4] are set to be exactly wrong - 180 degrees from each other, circled in blue. \n","\n","The first step is to compute the cosine similarity matrix or `score` in the code.

Because Q1[n] is a duplicate of only Q2[n], other combinations are explicitly created negative examples or *Hard Negative* examples. The matrix multiplication efficiently produces the cosine similarity of all positive/negative combinations as shown above on the left side of the diagram. 'Positive' are the results of duplicate examples and 'negative' are the results of explicitly created negative examples. The results for our test case are as expected, V1[0]V2[0] match producing '1' while our other 'positive' cases (in green) don't match well, as was arranged. The V2[2] was set to match V1[3] producing a poor match at `score[2,2]` and an undesired 'negative' case of a '1' shown in grey. \n","\n","With the similarity matrix (`score`) we can begin to implement the loss equations. First, we can extract $$cos(A,P)$$ by utilizing `fastnp.diagonal`. The goal is to grab all the green entries in the diagram above. This is `positive` in the code.\n","\n","Next, we will create the *closest_negative*. This is the nonduplicate entry in V2 that is closest (has largest cosine similarity) to an entry in V1. Each row, n, of `score` represents all comparisons of the results of Q1[n] vs Q2[x] within a batch. A specific example in our testcase is row `score[2,:]`. It has the cosine similarity of V1[2] and V2[x]. The *closest_negative*, as was arranged, is V2[2] which has a score of 1. This is the maximum value of the 'negative' entries (blue entries in the diagram).\n","\n","To implement this, we need to pick the maximum entry on a row of `score`, ignoring the 'positive'/green entries. To avoid selecting the 'positive'/green entries, we can make them larger negative numbers. Multiply `fastnp.eye(batch_size)` with 2.0 and subtract it out of `scores`. The result is `negative_without_positive`. Now we can use `fastnp.max`, row by row (axis=1), to select the maximum which is `closest_negative`.\n","\n","Next, we'll create *mean_negative*. As the name suggests, this is the mean of all the 'negative'/blue values in `score` on a row by row basis. We can use `fastnp.eye(batch_size)` and a constant, this time to create a mask with zeros on the diagonal. Element-wise multiply this with `score` to get just the 'negative values. This is `negative_zero_on_duplicate` in the code. Compute the mean by using `fastnp.sum` on `negative_zero_on_duplicate` for `axis=1` and divide it by `(batch_size - 1)` . This is `mean_negative`.\n","\n","Now, we can compute loss using the two equations above and `fastnp.maximum`. This will form `triplet_loss1` and `triplet_loss2`. \n","\n","`triple_loss` is the `fastnp.mean` of the sum of the two individual losses.\n","\n","Once you have this code matching the expected results, you can clip out the section between ### START CODE HERE and ### END CODE HERE it out and insert it into TripletLoss below.\n","\n"," \n","<\\details>  "]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"rOduqWhWj5Qo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1612095543626,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":611,"user":{"displayName":"Martin Fabbri","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GimIntWE1SvxJeoWOj0PwvUuB_-simILm2JI8het08=s64","userId":"04899005791450850059"}}},"source":["# UNQ_C3 (UNIQUE CELL IDENTIFIER, DO NOT EDIT)\n","# GRADED FUNCTION: TripletLossFn\n","def TripletLossFn(v1, v2, margin=0.25):\n","    \"\"\"Custom Loss function.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        v1 (numpy.ndarray): Array with dimension (batch_size, model_dimension) associated to Q1.\n","        v2 (numpy.ndarray): Array with dimension (batch_size, model_dimension) associated to Q2.\n","        margin (float, optional): Desired margin.
