NER is a subtask of information extraction that locates and classifies named entities in a text. The named entities could be organizations, persons, locations, times, etc. \r\n","\r\n","For example:\r\n","\r\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/martin-fabbri/colab-notebooks/raw/master/deeplearning.ai/nlp/images/ner.png\" width=\"500px\"/>\r\n","\r\n","Is labeled as follows: \r\n","\r\n","- French: geopolitical entity\r\n","- Morocco: geographic entity \r\n","- Christmas: time indicator\r\n","\r\n","Everything else that is labeled with an `O` is not considered to be a named entity. In this assignment, you will train a named entity recognition system that could be trained in a few seconds (on a GPU) and will get around 75% accuracy. Then, you will load in the exact version of your model, which was trained for a longer period of time. You could then evaluate the trained version of your model to get 96% accuracy! Finally, you will be able to test your named entity recognition system with your own sentence."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8IjjHkZjFTVn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1611805354049,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":28641,"user":{"displayName":"Martin Fabbri","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GimIntWE1SvxJeoWOj0PwvUuB_-simILm2JI8het08=s64","userId":"04899005791450850059"}}},"source":["%%capture\r\n","!pip -q install trax==1.3.1"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1feWRYDQDwus"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
