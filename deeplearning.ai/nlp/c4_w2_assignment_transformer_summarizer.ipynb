Rangers face Derby County in the Championship play-off final at Wembley on May 24, with Harry Redknapp's side hoping to secure the \\u00a3120m pay packet of Premier League promotion. But, should QPR return to the top tier at the first attempt, they could be forced to pay out more than half of that in fines under the Football League's Financial Fair Play regulations. We're ready: Queens Park Rangers chairman Tony Fernandes says his club doesn't have to win promotion . Off to Wembley: Rangers won their way through to the play-off final after extra-time against Wigan . Based on last year's accounts, Rangers would have to pay \\u00a362.1m if they are promoted because their \\u00a365.4m losses were so far in excess of the \\u00a38m allowed by the Football League. Should Redknapp's side stay in the Championship, however, they would be subjected to a transfer embargo. QPR have tried to reduce their wage bill by selling high-earners such as Christopher Samba and sending the likes of Loic Remy and Adel Taarabt out on loan. Improved: Businessman Fernandes says QPR are in a better financial position than two years ago . Winner: QPR striker Charlie Austin finds the net to snatch the victory in the play-off second leg . Fernandes told talkSPORT: 'Yes, we can (afford not to go up). I'm an accountant by background - although I may not seem it! 'We've told the fans, whether we go up or we don't, we're here for the long term. 'We know what culture we want at the club and we will continue the journey whether we're in the Championship or the Premier League. 'We are a much smarter, much wiser group of people than we were two years ago.' Relief: QPR's bid to reduce their wage bills included off-loading players such  as Christopher Samba .

The U.S. study analysed worldwide searches for 'iPhone slow' and found that the search term spiked significantly around the time of new iPhone launch. It then compared those results with similar searches for the term 'Samsung Galaxy slow', and discovered the term was unaffected by new releases from Samsung. A new study is backing up long held suspicions that Apple slows down older models of iPhones to encourage users to buy its new release. The U.S. study analysed worldwide searches for 'iPhone slow' and found that the search term spiked significantly around the time of new phone releases . The study, compiled by Harvard University PhD student Laura Trucco, follows claims that the Cupertino-based company is deliberately sabotaging its old products. Writing for the New York Times, Sendhil Mullainathan, a professor of economics at Harvard, described the results as 'striking'. 'Wouldn't many business owners love to make their old product less useful whenever they released a newer one?' Mr Mullainathan wrote. \\u2018When you sell the device and control the operating system, that's an option'. The study then compared those results with similar searches for the term 'Samsung Galaxy slow', and found the term was unaffected by new releases from Samsung . While some MailOnline readers haven't noticed a slow down, others claim that Apple is sabotaging older phones through software updates. 'This is common knowledge,' one reader wrote. 'If you want to keep your iPhone running at the same pace do not do the software upgrade that comes out within six months of a new iPhone release,' Last year, Catherine Rampell, also writing in the New York Times, raised concerns that Apple could be engineering the new operating system so it only works properly with the newest version of the product. She said her iPhone 4 became a lot slower when she downloaded iOS 7 - and that the only solution seemed to be to buy the iPhone 5. Ms Rampell accused Apple of having run out of ideas so was trying to \\u2018brainwash\\u2019 its customers into buying the new iPhone 5S and 5C because they look nice. Her claims fuelled conspiracy theorists who have long held that Apple engages in \\u2018planned obsolescence\\u2019, a term which has been around since the Great Depression in the 1930s. The theory states that manufacturers of everything from cars to microwaves build in a certain lifetime to a product and then it will simply stop working, forcing consumers to buy a new one. And Apple has faced allegations that it is guilty of planned obsolescence before. Last year, Catherine Rampell, also writing in the New York Times, raised concerns that Apple could be engineering the new operating system so it only works properly with the newest version of the product . A security expert has warned Apple\\u2019s iOS software contains potentially sinister tools that could be used by governments to spy on iPhone and iPad users. Speaking at the 'Hackers on planet Earth' conference in New York, Jonathan Zdziarski said that most users are unaware of the lack of protection for iPhone data. He added files found hidden within the firm's software contain a file-relay service that can be used to access the user's address book, photos, voicemail and any accounts configured on the device. However, Apple has denied the claims the backdoor was created deliberately for government or surveillance purposes. His investigation followed earlier reports of the NSA spying on Apple products, which suggested a \\u2018backdoor\\u2019 in iOS could provide hackers with valuable information. A backdoor is a hidden remote access port that can allow outside sources to access a device with little detection. The conclusion was based on an analysis of 600 million iOS devices, with handsets running the most recent versions of the software at particular risk. When it started using more tamper-resistant screws experts said it was to stop users getting into the phone and fixing it themselves if there was a problem. Meanwhile, in 2012 Apple was sued in Brazil by the Brazilian Institute of Politics and Law Software over the launch of the iPad Air. The organisation claimed that because it had the new retina screen it made the iPad 3 redundant and that Apple was changing its devices too quickly. Ms Rampell said: \\u2018When major innovations remain out of reach, and degrading durability threatens to tick off loyal customers, companies like Apple can still take a cue from the fashion industry. \\u2018If you can brainwash consumers into developing new tastes that make the old stuff look uncool for aesthetic rather than functional reasons, you still have a shot at harvesting more sales from your existing customer base. Dom Ferkin, managing direction of UK-based iOS experts, Creation Application, told MailOnline that he doesn\\u2019t believe Apple are doing this intentionally. \\u2018On every hardware release they tend to upgrade the chips and they are faster every time they are released,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018Each year they release a new iOS. If you\\u2019re running an iOS 7 on a 5 chip, for example, it\\u2019s comparable to running Windows XP on a Windows 95 machine. \\u2018It\\u2019s just enough to annoy the users, but it\\u2019s needed if you want the slew of new features that Apple releases each year.\\u2019 Mr Mullainathan added that the research does not prove that Apple has done anything wrong. No matter how suggestive, he says, the data alone doesn't allow anyone to determine conclusively whether their phone is any slower. There are other explanations for why an older model iPhone may slow down, he claims. For instance, the latest version of the Apple operating system, iOS, is always tailored to the newest device and may therefore not work as efficiently on older models. \\u2018Hearing about a new release makes you contemplate getting a new and faster phone,\\u2019 he added. \\u2018And you suddenly notice how slow your old phone is.\\u2019 Apple is yet to respond. But Mr Mullainathan added that the research does not prove that Apple has done anything wrong.No matter how suggestive, he says, the data alone doesn't allow anyone to determine conclusively whether their phone is any slower .\",\n\"The study was undertaken by student Laura Trucco at Harvard University .\\nIt also compared Apple's results with searches for 'Samsung Galaxy slow'\\nResearch found that the term was unaffected by Samsung new releases .\\nStudy has fuelled suggestions Apple engages in \\u2018planned obsolescence\\u2019\\nTheory states that manufacturers build in a certain lifetime to a product and then it will simply stop working, forcing consumers to buy a new one .\"],\n [{\n            'v': 2,\n            'f': \"2\",\n        },\n\"By . Kieran Corcoran . A British TV producer was killed in Qatar when a speeding motorcyclist hit her while racing a friend at high speed. Kerry Rome, 33, moved to Qatar to work for TV news station Al-Jazeera, and had been out with colleagues before being knocked down as she crossed the road at 2am, an inquest heard. She was the TV station's first female technical director, and moved to the Middle East for work with her husband Mark Harris, 35. Killed: Kerry Rome, pictured, was knocked down and killed by a motorcyclist in Qatar in 2012 . Police initially believed Mrs Rome's death was accidental - but it later emerged that the motorbike rider had no driving licence, and was racing a friend when he hit Mrs Rome on April 20, 2012. A 21-year-old man was convicted of killing Kerry in a Qatari court in 2012 with a judge describing his speed as 'excessive'. An inquest in Stamford, Lincolnshire, heard that the biker hit Mrs Rome - who had just stepped out into the road - while trying to under-take his rival. Moments after stepping into the road she was struck by the motorcyclist as he attempted to under-take his friend. Giving evidence, Mrs Rome's mother Margaret, 62, described the moment she found out about her daughter\\u2019s death as 'the worst phone call of my life'. She added: 'My lovely daughter Kerry would be here today if that reckless, dangerous motorcyclist had not been racing with a friend at 2am'. Mr Harris also paid tribute to his late wife, whom he had married just months before her death in an Elvis-themed Las Vegas wedding. 'Excessive': The motorcyclist was undertaking his rival in a street race when he hit Mrs Rome. A Qatari court convicted him of the killing . Mark, originally from Market Deeping Lincolnshire, said: 'Kerry was an amazing person. She was kind, generous, there to help and never had a bad word to say about anyone. 'We were career-oriented adults who relocated abroad to make a good life and good careers for ourselves. 'This was all taken away by a man who was out racing a motorbike with his friends.' A toxicology report carried out in Qatar found 296mg of alcohol per 100ml in Kerry\\u2019s blood, around three-and-a-half times the British drink-drive limit. Three of Mrs Rome's colleagues told the hearing she did not appear drunk on the night she died. Oliver Walker said: 'We had a few drinks but nothing major as we were dancing close to the stage. It\\u2019s not like we were pounding shots at the bar'. South Lincolnshire coroner Professor Robert Forrest said: 'It had appeared that the motorcyclist was undertaking one of his companions when the collision took place.' Middle East: Mrs Rome moved to Qatar for work with her husband Mark Harris . He added that there was insufficient evidence to produce a verdict of unlawful killing, instead recording the incident as a death caused as a result of a road traffic collision. A friend of the family said today: 'The family are obviously disappointed that the coroner effectively delivered a verdict of accidental death. 'It is the family\\u2019s position that Kerry was not killed in an accident. The motorcyclist hit her during an illegal road race. 'If he had not been taking part in an illegal activity Kerry would still be here today.' Kerry and her husband Mark moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2008 when she became the first female technical director of live news at Al Jazeera English. They then transferred to Doha in October 2011 when Kerry was promoted to Al Jazeera English\\u2019s head office. Speaking after the inquest, her mother said: 'She was such a vivacious person and so full of life. Considering how young she was she has done so much in her life. 'When we went out there and saw what life was like we realised how strong a person she was. We are all so incredibly proud of her and what she did.' Kirsty Rome, her sister, added: 'We were all really close, she loved her family. She did more in her 33 years than most do in a lifetime.'\",\n\"Kerry Rome, 33, was killed around 2am on April 20, 2012 .\\nShe was hit by biker who was undertaking his rival, inquest heard .\\nMrs Rome moved to Qatar for work, and had married just months before .\\nShe was the first ever female technical director at Al-Jazeera TV station .\"],\n [{\n            'v': 3,\n            'f': \"3\",\n        },\n\"By .

The bishop of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A virus in late September and early October. The state Health Department has issued an advisory of exposure for anyone who attended five churches and took communion. Bishop John Folda (pictured) of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A . State Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell says the risk is low, but officials feel it's important to alert people to the possible exposure. The diocese announced on Monday that Bishop John Folda is taking time off after being diagnosed with hepatitis A. The diocese says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month. Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal discomfort.

Residents on the Victorian estate in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, are now forced to make a four-mile round trip collect their letters and parcels from a central depot. Royal Mail postmen are refusing to deliver to The Villas after it became a no-go zone due to 'a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping'. Resident Catherine Burgass said the move by Royal Mail has 'annoyed' all of the residents at The Villas . Yesterday home-owners on the road, which is not council-maintained as it is privately run by the residents' association, said their mail had been delivered without a problem for 150 years and slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any warning. The estate's residents' association has asked Royal Mail to identify which areas need repairing but say it would cost tens of thousands of pounds to tarmac the entire stretch. Elderly resident Alfred Poole, 79, branded the move 'barmy'. He said: 'Its health and safety gone mad. I'm an old man and if I can manage the paving slabs, I'm sure the postman can. 'I haven't got a car and I can't walk four miles to fetch my post. It's just ridiculous.' Royal Mail say they suspended deliveries to the street for health and safety reasons following 'incidents' Julian Wilshaw, 38, who lives with his partner Sarah and daughter Jessica, added: 'It came out of the blue. 'We had heard nothing at all about it and then the letter came through. 'We weren't even warned or informed there was an issue, so we could maybe try to help put any issues right. 'Royal Mail deliver to the likes of the Isle of Skye and the Hebrides - we're just The Villas, in Stoke. 'My daughter has hip problems and we're waiting on a letter from the hospital. 'I have sympathy for the postmen if they've hurt themselves, but we don't know what the problem is, and Royal Mail have been delivering to us for years. 'It's a massive inconvenience for all the residents, especially the more elderly people living here.' A total of 40 households and over 100 residents have been affected by the ban. Ms Burgass said the pavement has been in the same condition since she moved in 15 years ago . Martin Parker, 52, secretary of The Villas Residents' Association, said: 'The letter said one postman had injured themselves a month ago, and we were told it happened again a couple of days before the letter was sent. 'No-one had been consulted about any problems with the state of the pavements and I'm surprised they hadn't bothered to consult with us. 'It would have been sensible for them to speak to us, and it's bizarre Royal Mail has taken this rather extreme stance. 'The road is not slippery, our bins are emptied and post had been delivered here for a very long time. 'Luckily, I have a car and I'm physically fit, but there are quite a few elderly residents and there's the care home here too. 'Also, no-one seems to be able to contact the phone number attached with the letter.' Doug Burnham, 49, who has lived on The Villas for 15 years, added: 'It's a very difficult situation. I can't see how our neighbourhood differs from any other neighbourhood. Residents have slammed Royal Mail for not giving them any warning about the cancellation of the service . 'Sweeping and cleaning is something we do as often as possible. We also tackle things like potholes, drainage issues and fly-tipping. 'We are open to discussions. 'We would be willing to pay if there were particularly problematic areas and we do that anyway, but obviously we couldn't do the entirety of the paving.' Resident Catherine Burgass, 47, added: 'I was extremely surprised we had not had any prior warning. 'The pavement has been in the same condition since I moved in 15 years ago. 'Everybody's annoyed about it.' A Royal Mail spokesperson said: 'We have taken the decision to suspend deliveries to a small number of addresses after a number of incidents involving colleagues falling and slipping.

It then compared those results with similar searches\n","for the term 'Samsung Galaxy slow', and discovered the term was\n","unaffected by new releases from Samsung. A new study is backing up\n","long held suspicions that Apple slows down older models of iPhones to\n","encourage users to buy its new release. The U.S. study analysed\n","worldwide searches for 'iPhone slow' and found that the search term\n","spiked significantly around the time of new phone releases . The\n","study, compiled by Harvard University PhD student Laura Trucco,\n","follows claims that the Cupertino-based company is deliberately\n","sabotaging its old products. Writing for the New York Times, Sendhil\n","Mullainathan, a professor of economics at Harvard, described the\n","results as 'striking'. 'Wouldn't many business owners love to make\n","their old product less useful whenever they released a newer one?' Mr\n","Mullainathan wrote. ‘When you sell the device and control the\n","operating system, that's an option'. The study then compared those\n","results with similar searches for the term 'Samsung Galaxy slow', and\n","found the term was unaffected by new releases from Samsung . While\n","some MailOnline readers haven't noticed a slow down, others claim that\n","Apple is sabotaging older phones through software updates. 'This is\n","common knowledge,' one reader wrote. 'If you want to keep your iPhone\n","running at the same pace do not do the software upgrade that comes out\n","within six months of a new iPhone release,' Last year, Catherine\n","Rampell, also writing in the New York Times, raised concerns that\n","Apple could be engineering the new operating system so it only works\n","properly with the newest version of the product. She said her iPhone 4\n","became a lot slower when she downloaded iOS 7 - and that the only\n","solution seemed to be to buy the iPhone 5. Ms Rampell accused Apple of\n","having run out of ideas so was trying to ‘brainwash’ its customers\n","into buying the new iPhone 5S and 5C because they look nice. Her\n","claims fuelled conspiracy theorists who have long held that Apple\n","engages in ‘planned obsolescence’, a term which has been around since\n","the Great Depression in the 1930s. The theory states that\n","manufacturers of everything from cars to microwaves build in a certain\n","lifetime to a product and then it will simply stop working, forcing\n","consumers to buy a new one. And Apple has faced allegations that it is\n","guilty of planned obsolescence before. Last year, Catherine Rampell,\n","also writing in the New York Times, raised concerns that Apple could\n","be engineering the new operating system so it only works properly with\n","the newest version of the product . A security expert has warned\n","Apple’s iOS software contains potentially sinister tools that could be\n","used by governments to spy on iPhone and iPad users. Speaking at the\n","'Hackers on planet Earth' conference in New York, Jonathan Zdziarski\n","said that most users are unaware of the lack of protection for iPhone\n","data. He added files found hidden within the firm's software contain a\n","file-relay service that can be used to access the user's address book,\n","photos, voicemail and any accounts configured on the device. However,\n","Apple has denied the claims the backdoor was created deliberately for\n","government or surveillance purposes. His investigation followed\n","earlier reports of the NSA spying on Apple products, which suggested a\n","‘backdoor’ in iOS could provide hackers with valuable information. A\n","backdoor is a hidden remote access port that can allow outside sources\n","to access a device with little detection. The conclusion was based on\n","an analysis of 600 million iOS devices, with handsets running the most\n","recent versions of the software at particular risk. When it started\n","using more tamper-resistant screws experts said it was to stop users\n","getting into the phone and fixing it themselves if there was a\n","problem. Meanwhile, in 2012 Apple was sued in Brazil by the Brazilian\n","Institute of Politics and Law Software over the launch of the iPad\n","Air. The organisation claimed that because it had the new retina\n","screen it made the iPad 3 redundant and that Apple was changing its\n","devices too quickly. Ms Rampell said: ‘When major innovations remain\n","out of reach, and degrading durability threatens to tick off loyal\n","customers, companies like Apple can still take a cue from the fashion\n","industry. ‘If you can brainwash consumers into developing new tastes\n","that make the old stuff look uncool for aesthetic rather than\n","functional reasons, you still have a shot at harvesting more sales\n","from your existing customer base. Dom Ferkin, managing direction of\n","UK-based iOS experts, Creation Application, told MailOnline that he\n","doesn’t believe Apple are doing this intentionally. ‘On every hardware\n","release they tend to upgrade the chips and they are faster every time\n","they are released,’ he said. ‘Each year they release a new iOS. If\n","you’re running an iOS 7 on a 5 chip, for example, it’s comparable to\n","running Windows XP on a Windows 95 machine. ‘It’s just enough to annoy\n","the users, but it’s needed if you want the slew of new features that\n","Apple releases each year.’ Mr Mullainathan added that the research\n","does not prove that Apple has done anything wrong. No matter how\n","suggestive, he says, the data alone doesn't allow anyone to determine\n","conclusively whether their phone is any slower. There are other\n","explanations for why an older model iPhone may slow down, he claims.\n","For instance, the latest version of the Apple operating system, iOS,\n","is always tailored to the newest device and may therefore not work as\n","efficiently on older models. ‘Hearing about a new release makes you\n","contemplate getting a new and faster phone,’ he added. ‘And you\n","suddenly notice how slow your old phone is.’ Apple is yet to respond.\n","But Mr Mullainathan added that the research does not prove that Apple\n","has done anything wrong.No matter how suggestive, he says, the data\n","alone doesn't allow anyone to determine conclusively whether their\n","phone is any slower .<EOS><pad>Thestudy was undertaken by student\n","Laura Trucco at Harvard University .

lined up for a Sunday afternoon march calling for Japan's\n","nuclear power stations to be shut down. A week before, a similar\n","protest -- though in a chilly drizzle, not on a warm, sunny day --\n","drew about 250. And a month of frustration, desperation and anger\n","boiled over at Tokyo Electric Power Company's headquarters Friday as\n","officials from towns around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant\n","demanded to know when the crisis that has besieged their farming\n","communities would end. \"The nuclear plant situation needs to be\n","resolved as soon as possible. If not, we farmers will die,\" one of the\n","officials, Iwao Suzuki, told the utility's executives. But the\n","response from Naomi Hirose, the managing director of Japan's largest\n","utility, offered little encouragement to the delegation or the rest of\n","the world. \"There is a need to draw an end to the current situation as\n","soon as possible,\" Hirose said, adding, \"We totally agree to this and\n","are taking the utmost endeavors to contain the radiation.\" Since the\n","March 11 earthquake that ravaged northern Japan, workers at Fukushima\n","Daiichi have been struggling to cool down three overheated reactors\n","and keep pools of spent but still potent nuclear fuel from spreading\n","further radioactive contamination across northern Japan. A month into\n","the crisis, the utility acknowledges, there is no end in sight. The\n","problems are so far \"beyond the design capacity\" of the plant that the\n","Japanese are working in uncharted territory, said Michael Friedlander,\n","a former senior operator at U.S. nuclear power plants. \"No nuclear\n","power plant has ever considered the inability to get on long-term core\n","cooling for more than a week, much less three weeks,\" Friedlander\n","said. Some Japanese experts now say the effort is in danger of failing\n","unless Japan seeks more help from international experts to bring it to\n","an end. Tetsunari Iida, an engineer-turned-industry critic, said the\n","situation is \"beyond the reach\" of Japan's closely knit nuclear\n","establishment. \"A real exit strategy has to start with an inspection\n","by the world's top experts on nuclear accidents,\" Iida told reporters\n","at Japan's national press club last week. Engineers and workers so far\n","have managed to stave off a complete meltdown in Fukushima Daiichi's\n","reactors 1-3 and in the spent fuel pool of unit 4. But experts say the\n","overheated fuel rods are likely to have suffered extensive damage, and\n","there is a complication for seemingly every advance. Much of the past\n","week was dominated by the attempt to stop water laced with massive\n","amounts of radioactive particles from pouring into the Pacific Ocean\n","-- water that comes out of the reactors \"screaming with\n","radioactivity,\" Friedlander said. Tokyo Electric is now grappling with\n","where to put the stuff, even dumping thousands of tons of less-\n","radioactive water into the Pacific to make room for it in a reservoir\n","for low-level waste. In a normally functioning plant, coolant water is\n","circulated out of the reactors and chilled. Then it's pumped back in\n","to carry more heat away from the plant's fuel rods, which continue\n","producing energy long after the chain reaction at the heart of the\n","units has been stopped. \"You have to get the recirculation system up\n","and functioning so they can cool that water in the normal way,\" said\n","Gary Was, a nuclear engineering professor at the University of\n","Michigan and a CNN consultant. Normal cooling systems don't require\n","the massive amounts of water -- around 7 metric tons (1,850 gallons)\n","per hour -- now being poured into the reactors. \"That's a big\n","problem,\" Was said. Tokyo Electric officials told CNN they can't say\n","when they'll be able to restore those normal cooling. The first step\n","is to get highly radioactive water out of the flooded basements of the\n","units' turbine plants, then figure out how badly the equipment inside\n","has been damaged. For the first two weeks of the crisis, engineers\n","pumped seawater into the reactors. But the resulting buildup of salt\n","inside has made it harder for coolant to circulate, U.S. nuclear\n","safety officials advised in March. In addition, Was said, the fuel\n","rods are likely in a state of \"partial melt,\" the extent of which will\n","be difficult to determine. After 1979's Three Mile Island accident in\n","Pennsylvania, it took more than two years before operators were able\n","to get a camera into the reactor to examine its condition, he said.\n","Satoshi Sato, a Japanese nuclear industry consultant, called the\n","current line of attack a \"waste of effort.\" Plant instruments are\n","likely damaged and unreliable because of the intense heat that was\n","generated, and pumping more water into the reactors is only making the\n","contamination problem worse, he said. \"There is no happy end with\n","their approach,\" Sato told CNN. \"They must change the approach. That's\n","something I'm sure of 100 percent.\" After the 1986 Chernobyl accident,\n","the world's worst to date, the Soviet Union encased the plant's\n","damaged reactor in a massive concrete sarcophagus. Iida said Fukushima\n","Daiichi's reactors remain too hot to pour concrete, but he suggested\n","pouring a slurry of minerals and sand over them to carry away heat\n","before encasing them. And Was said the reactors have to be cooled in\n","order to let the molten fuel harden again: \"Only when it solidifies\n","are you sure you can contain it.\" He said Tokyo Electric should be in\n","the lead -- \"It's their plant\" -- but he added, \"There's a lot of\n","different areas in which they could benefit from international help.\"\n","Japan's government is consulting with experts from the U.S. Nuclear\n","Regulatory Commission and the French nuclear fuel company Areva, said\n","Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy director-general of Japan's Nuclear and\n","Industrial Safety Agency and the agency's chief spokesman. U.S. Navy\n","barges have been carrying fresh water to Fukushima Daiichi, and\n","Tokyo's foreign ministry has asked Russia about using a Japanese-built\n","ship outfitted as a floating decontamination plant. \"We already have\n","quite a bit of support from outside countries and organizations,\"\n","Nishiyama said. But he added, \"I think the most urgent issue now is\n","support in whatever form possible with regard to how we can dispose of\n","the cooling water and be able to build a sustainable cooling system.\"\n","General Electric which designed the reactors, and Hitachi, which built\n","most of the plant, are also advising the government and Tokyo\n","Electric. GE chief Jeffrey Immelt flew to Japan to consult with\n","Japanese officials and executives last week, and Tokyo has asked\n","Russian officials about using a Japanese-built ship outfitted as a\n","floating decontamination plant. But for now, Japan has \"no choice\" but\n","to continue pouring water into the reactors, Friedlander said. \"I have\n","no doubt that the men and women working at the power plant are indeed\n","going to exert every human effort to make sure that they resolve\n","this,\" he said. \"What I don't know and what I can't tell and the big\n","question mark for me is, will it be done sooner than later? \"And\n","again, my hope is, is that it'll be done sooner. But in order for it\n","to be done sooner, TEPCO's going to have to step up and ask for more\n","help from the international community.\" Ailing Chang and CNN's Brian\n","Walker contributed to this report.<EOS><pad>Notimetable has been\n","crafted for restoring normal cooling, Tokyo Electric says .
