This will help in understanding how to use layers like `Select` and `Residual` which operates on elements in the stack. If you've taken a computer science class before, you will recall that a stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. That is, whatever is the latest element that is pushed into the stack will also be the first one to be popped out. If you're not yet familiar with stacks, then you may find this [short tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_data_structure/python_stack.htm) useful. In a nutshell, all you really need to remember is it puts elements one on top of the other. You should be aware of what is on top of the stack to know which element you will be popping.

The inputs first goes through a `Select` layer, followed by a `Residual` layer which passes the `Fn: Addition()` layer as an argument. What this means is the `Residual` layer will take the stack top input at that point and add it to the output of the `Fn: Addition()` layer.
