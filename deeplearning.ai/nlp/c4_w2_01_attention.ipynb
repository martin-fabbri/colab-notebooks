Like LSTMs, they learn which words are most important to phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and so on. Moreover, they mitigate the vanishing gradient problem even better than LSTMs. You've already seen how to combine attention with LSTMs to build **encoder-decoder models** for applications such as machine translation. \r\n","\r\n","<img src=\"attention_lnb_figs/C4_W2_L3_dot-product-attention_S01_introducing-attention_stripped.png\" width=\"500\"/>\r\n","\r\n","This week, you'll see how to integrate attention into **transformers**. Because transformers are not sequence models, they are much easier to parallelize and accelerate. Beyond machine translation, applications of transformers include: \r\n","* Auto-completion\r\n","* Named Entity Recognition\r\n","* Chatbots\r\n","* Question-Answering\r\n","* And more!\r\n","\r\n","Along with embedding, positional encoding, dense layers, and residual connections, attention is a crucial component of transformers. At the heart of any attention scheme used in a transformer is **dot product attention**, of which the figures below display a simplified picture:\r\n","\r\n","<img src=\"attention_lnb_figs/C4_W2_L3_dot-product-attention_S03_concept-of-attention_stripped.png\" width=\"500\"/>\r\n","\r\n","<img src=\"attention_lnb_figs/C4_W2_L3_dot-product-attention_S04_attention-math_stripped.png\" width=\"500\"/>\r\n","\r\n","With basic dot product attention, you capture the interactions between every word (embedding) in your query and every word in your key. If the queries and keys belong to the same sentences, this constitutes **bi-directional self-attention**. In some situations, however, it's more appropriate to consider only words which have come before the current one. Such cases, particularly when the queries and keys come from the same sentences, fall into the category of **causal attention**. \r\n","\r\n","<img src=\"attention_lnb_figs/C4_W2_L4_causal-attention_S02_causal-attention_stripped.png\" width=\"500\"/>\r\n","\r\n","For causal attention, we add a **mask** to the argument of our softmax function, as illustrated below: \r\n","\r\n","<img src=\"attention_lnb_figs/C4_W2_L4_causal-attention_S03_causal-attention-math_stripped.png\" width=\"500\"/>\r\n","\r\n","<img src=\"attention_lnb_figs/C4_W2_L4_causal-attention_S04_causal-attention-math-2_stripped.png\" width=\"500\"/>\r\n","\r\n","Now let's see how to implement attention with NumPy. When you integrate attention into a transformer network defined with Trax, you'll have to use `trax.fastmath.numpy` instead, since Trax's arrays are based on JAX DeviceArrays. Fortunately, the function interfaces are often identical."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"gi2XjQ3bo9KB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1612822230103,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":1246,"user":{"displayName":"Martin Fabbri","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GimIntWE1SvxJeoWOj0PwvUuB_-simILm2JI8het08=s64","userId":"04899005791450850059"}},"outputId":"a5154802-38fe-434f-a055-4580b8754bcf"},"source":["import sys\r\n","\r\n","import numpy as np\r\n","import scipy.special\r\n","\r\n","import textwrap\r\n","wrapper = textwrap.TextWrapper(width=70)\r\n","\r\n","# to print the entire np array\r\n","np.set_printoptions(threshold=sys.maxsize)\r\n","\r\n","!pip list | grep scipy"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["scipy                         1.4.1          \n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5JQWi3xMswHi"},"source":["Here are some helper functions that will help you create tensors and display useful information:\r\n","\r\n","* `create_tensor()` creates a numpy array from a list of lists.\r\n","* `display_tensor()` prints out the shape and the actual tensor."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"XaHEAZ-0se9e"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
