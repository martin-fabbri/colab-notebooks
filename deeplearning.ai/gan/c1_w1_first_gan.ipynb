You will be using PyTorch in this specialization, so if you're not familiar with this framework, you may find the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) useful. The hints will also often include links to relevant documentation.\n",

Batches are sets of images that will be predicted on before the loss functions are calculated (instead of calculating the loss function after each image).
