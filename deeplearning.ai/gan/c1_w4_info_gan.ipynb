        "In this notebook, you're going to learn about InfoGAN in order to generate disentangled outputs, based on the paper, [InfoGAN: Interpretable Representation Learning by Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03657) by Chen et. al. While there are many approaches to disentanglement, this is one of the more widely used and better known. \r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "InfoGAN can be understood like this: you want to separate your model into two parts: $z$, corresponding to truly random noise, and $c$ corresponding to the \"latent code.\" The latent code $c$ which can be thought of as a \"hidden\" condition in a conditional generator, and you'd like it to have an interpretable meaning. \r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Now, you'll likely immediately wonder, how do they get $c$, which is just some random set of numbers, to be more interpretable than any dimension in a typical GAN? The answer is \"mutual information\": essentially, you would like each dimension of the latent code to be as obvious a function as possible of the generated images. Read on for a more thorough theoretical and practical treatment."
