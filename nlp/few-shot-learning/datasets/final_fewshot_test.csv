1197,"Implement reading from null safe dereferences

Null safe dereferences make handling null or missing values shorter.
Compare without:
```
if (ctx._source.missing != null && ctx._source.missing.foo != null) {
  ctx._source.foo_length = ctx.source.missing.foo.length()
}
```

To with:
```
Integer length = ctx._source.missing?.foo?.length();
if (length != null) {
  ctx._source.foo_length = length
}
```

Combining this with the as of yet unimplemented elvis operator allows
for very concise defaults for nulls:
```
ctx._source.foo_length = ctx._source.missing?.foo?.length() ?: 0;
```

Since you have to start somewhere, we started with null safe dereferenes.

Anyway, this is a feature borrowed from groovy. Groovy allows writing to
null values like:
```
def v = null
v?.field = 'cat'
```
And the writes are simply ignored. Painless doesn't support this at this
point because it'd be complex to implement and maybe not all that useful.

There is no runtime cost for this feature if it is not used. When it is
used we implement it fairly efficiently, adding a jump rather than a
temporary variable.

This should also work fairly well with doc values.",4

as encoded by this XContentType.

1718,"Reindex from remote

This adds a remote option to reindex that looks like

```
curl -POST 'localhost:9200/_reindex?pretty' -d'{
  ""source"": {
    ""remote"": {
      ""host"": ""http://otherhost:9200""

        ""foo"": ""bar""
      }
    }
  },
  ""dest"": {
    ""index"": ""target""
  }
}'
```

This reindex has all of the features of local reindex:
* Using queries to filter what is copied
* Retry on rejection
* Throttle/rethottle
The big advantage of this version is that it goes over the HTTP API
which can be made backwards compatible.

Some things are different:

The query field is sent directly to the other node rather than parsed
on the coordinating node. This should allow it to support constructs
that are invalid on the coordinating node but are valid on the target
node. Mostly, that means old syntax.",4

I've fixed by removing that code and instead at the time of performing HA, do a quick check to see if there are pwork underway for the same VM and work scheduled in the future for that VM.  If there are work scheduled in the future, then we simply cancel the current work.  If there are already work underway, then we retry again in 1 minute.",1

The issue is that while backing up a snapshot when cloudstack tries to update the parent (of the backed up vhd), vhd-util isn't present at the desired location and setParent function in vmopsSnapshot fails. This issue is observed only on Xenserver 6.1. The reason for this is, when to a Xenserver and executes the SetupCommand, it copies vhd-util tool to /opt/xensource/bin directory on the host. However, in vmopsSnapshot python file 'VHD_UTIL' is initialized to /usr/sbin/. The issue is not observed on 6.0.2 (and I guess previous versions) because vhd-util is present in /usr/sbin/ directory by default (after a clean install). Whereas, in Xenserver 6.1, vhd-util is present in '/usr/bin'. Fixed the issue by updating VHD_UTIL to point to /opt/xensource/bin/vhd-util in vmopsSnapshot file.",1

* Support Dropwizard applications without logback

This is a prototype for splitting the tight integration between Dropwizard and Logback.
This feature was requested several times (See #1637). The idea is too provide users the
ability to exclude Logback from Dropwizard and replace it with an external logging
solution, if they really want to. The main work of this PR is too initialize the Logback
infrastructure lazily, so the user can swap it to an external logging mechanism in the
config file.

* Mention in the docs how do exclude Logback

For people who use Spark which forces log4j2.

Netty uses the number of processors for sizing various resources (e.g.,

of available processors which might not match the configured number of
processors as set in Elasticsearch to limit the number of threads (for
example, in Docker containers). A new feature was added to Netty that
enables configuring the number of processors Netty should see for sizing
this various resources. This commit takes advantage of this feature to
set this number of available processors to be equal to the configured
number of processors set in Elasticsearch.

2612,"Add version to prebuilt analyzers

This patch takes the version of the created index into account when a
prebuilt analyzer is created.
So, if an index was created with 0.90.4, then the prebuilt analyzers
will be the same than on the 0.90.4 release.

One reason for this feature is the possibility to change pre built
analyzers like the standard one.

The patch tries to reuse analyzers as mutch as possible. So even if
version X.Y.Z and X.Y.A use the same lucene analyzers, the same instance
is reused in order to prevent overcreation of lucene analyzer instances.

To validate values contained in an `Optional` type, we need to use a new
feature in Hibernate Validator 5.1, so this introduces a dependency
version bump to 5.1.1.

This makes use of an *experimental* feature in Hibernate Validator, so
I'm not 100% sure we'll want to make use of it yet.

To validate the contents of an `Optional`, you need to include an
`@UnwrapValidatedValue` annotation on the property being validated:

```java
@Length(min = 32, max = 32)
@UnwrapValidatedValue
private Optional<String> md5 = Optional.absent();
```

Absent values are considered `null` when validated, so their behaviour
depends on your chosen constraints' handling of `null` values.

We have to register this inside `Bootstrap`, and I noticed that we don't
(currently) expose a way for users to register more validation behaviour
through `Bootstrap`, so we should probably look in to that.",4

If the thread pools of an elasticsearch node cannot be shutdown
immediately, a wait of 10 seconds is added. This clashes with the
RPM scripts, as by default the init functions wait for 3 seconds
for a service to shutdown before a KILL signal is sent, resulting
in an unclean shutdown - not from an elasticsearch point of view,
but from init system point of view, as some lock files are left
around.

In order to prevent this the init script as well as the systemd
configuration now feature the same timeout than the debian package,
which is 20 seconds.

The await statement, which causes the 10 second delay can be found in

Think about it.  Why would anyone want to call one dao function, switch transaction, and then switch back when it fails.  The right thing is for the caller to switch transaction, call a series of dao codes, and switch it back in case it is invalid.  That's the semantics I changed to.

2458,"Change separator for shards preference

The shards preference on a search request enables specifying a list of
shards to hit, and then a secondary preference (e.g., ""_primary"") can be
added. Today, the separator between the shards list and the secondary
preference is ';'. Unfortunately, this is also a valid separtor for URL
query parameters. This means that a preference like ""_shards:0;_primary""
will be parsed into two URL parameters: ""_shards:0"" and ""_primary"". With
the recent change to strict URL parsing, the second parameter will be
rejected, ""_primary"" is not a valid URL parameter on a search
request. This means that this feature has never worked (unless the ';'
is escaped, but no one does that because our docs do not that, and there
was no indication from Elasticsearch that this did not work). This
commit changes the separator to '|'.

I've fixed by removing that code and instead at the time of performing HA, do a quick check to see if there are pwork underway for the same VM and work scheduled in the future for that VM.

This commit moves away from using stripe RAID-0 simumlation across multiple
data paths towards using a single path per shard. Multiple data paths are still
supported but shards and it's data is not striped across multiple paths / disks.
This will for instance prevent to loose all shards if a single disk is corrupted.

Indices that are using this features already will automatically upgraded to a single
datapath based on a simple diskspace based heuristic. In general there must be enough
diskspace to move a single shard at any time otherwise the upgrade will fail.
