        "## Transformer model for language understanding\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The core idea behind the Transformer model is *self-attention*â€”the ability to attend to different positions of the input sequence to compute a representation of that sequence. Transformer creates stacks of self-attention layers and is explained below in the sections *Scaled dot product attention* and *Multi-head attention*.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "A transformer model handles variable-sized input using stacks of self-attention layers instead of [RNNs](text_classification_rnn.ipynb) or [CNNs](../images/intro_to_cnns.ipynb). This general architecture has a number of advantages:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "* It make no assumptions about the temporal/spatial relationships across the data. This is ideal for processing a set of objects (for example, [StarCraft units](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/#block-8)).\r\n",
        "* Layer outputs can be calculated in parallel, instead of a series like an RNN.\r\n",
        "* Distant items can affect each other's output without passing through many RNN-steps, or convolution layers (see [Scene Memory Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03878.pdf) for example).\r\n",
        "* It can learn long-range dependencies. This is a challenge in many sequence tasks.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The downsides of this architecture are:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "* For a time-series, the output for a time-step is calculated from the *entire history* instead of only the inputs and current hidden-state. This _may_ be less efficient.   \r\n",
        "* If the input *does* have a  temporal/spatial relationship, like text, some positional encoding must be added or the model will effectively see a bag of words. \r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "After training the model in this notebook, you will be able to input a Portuguese sentence and return the English translation.\r\n",
